The full process of a supervised machine learning project, following the tutorial for a supervised machine learning project in chapter 2 of the second edition of "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.

The dataset used in this project is the California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository originally appearing in R. Kelley Pace and Ronald Barry, “Sparse Spatial Autoregressions,” Statistics & Probability Letters 33, no. 3 (1997)

The goal of this project is to predict the housing prices in California based on geographical location, median household income, population and several other attributes from the California Housing Prices dataset, get a better understanding of the steps in a typical supervised machine learning project, and see how Scikit-Learn can be used in this sort of project.

This project demonstrates how to work through a typical supervised machine learning project from start to finish, focusing on these steps:
  - Getting the data
  - Discovering and visualizing the data to gain insights
  - Preparing the data for machine learning algorithms
  - Selecting a model and training it
  - Evaluating and fine-tuning the model

This project proved to give interesting and valuable insights into the process of a machine learning project while studying supervised and non-supervised machine learning during my 5.year at INSA Toulouse
